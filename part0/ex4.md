## New Note diagram

The diagram showing first full load of the page is prepended with the POST step:

- with the payload encoded as the special form type
- and the response a 302 code redirecting to the notes page (and triggering a refresh and a full reloading)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant browser
    participant server

    browser->>server: POST https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/new_note
    activate server

    Note right of browser: Sent as FormData (x-www-form-urlencoded) in the payload.

    server-->>browser: 302 redirect HTML toward /note
    deactivate server

    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/notes
    activate server
    server-->>browser: HTML document
    deactivate server

    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/main.css
    activate server
    server-->>browser: the css file
    deactivate server

    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/main.js
    activate server
    server-->>browser: the JavaScript file
    deactivate server

    Note right of browser: The browser starts executing the JavaScript code that fetches the JSON from the server

    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/data.json
    activate server
    server-->>browser: [{ "content": "HTML is easy", "date": "2023-1-1" }, ... ]
    deactivate server

    Note right of browser: The browser executes the callback function that renders the notes
```

## Single page app

Going on SPA is the same as going on the first example, except for the URL and the name of the JS script:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant browser
    participant server

    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/spa
    activate server
    server-->>browser: HTML document
    deactivate server

    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/main.css
    activate server
    server-->>browser: the css file
    deactivate server

    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/spa.js
    activate server
    server-->>browser: the JavaScript file
    deactivate server

    Note right of browser: The browser starts executing the JavaScript code that fetches the JSON from the server

    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/data.json
    activate server
    server-->>browser: [{ "content": "HTML is easy", "date": "2023-1-1" }, ... ]
    deactivate server

    Note right of browser: The browser executes the callback function that renders the notes
```

## New note on SPA

But here it's just one controlled request (provided we correctly prevented default submit behaviour):

- The **rerendering** is done locally on the DOM
- Data are sent as json
- No refresh or reloading of anything

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant browser
    participant server

    browser->>server: POST https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/new_note
    activate server

    Note right of browser: Sent as JSON the payload.

    server-->>browser: 201 Created (confirm)
    deactivate server

    Note right of browser: The browser don't have to GET anything.
```
